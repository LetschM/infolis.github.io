    <i>Greetings, fellow afficionado of publication-dataset-integration.</i>

  <p>
    The <a class="page-link" href="/about-goals/">goal</a> of the InFoLiS project is to connect research data and publications. Links between data and literature are created automatically by means of text mining and made available as Linked Open Data (LOD) for seamless integration into different retrieval systems. This enables scientists to directly access information about corresponding research data in a literature information system, and, vice versa, it is possible to directly find different interpretations and analyses in the literature of the same research data
